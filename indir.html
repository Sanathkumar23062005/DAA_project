            <h2>Real-Time Toll Price Adjustment</h2>
            <p>Real-time toll price adjustment systems dynamically adjust toll rates based on real-time traffic conditions, ensuring optimized traffic flow while maximizing revenue for road maintenance. This technology relies on sensors, data analytics, and machine learning algorithms to adjust toll prices according to traffic volume, congestion, and time of day.</p>
            <p>By using real-time data, such as vehicle counts and traffic speeds, these systems can effectively reduce congestion during peak hours while providing cost-effective alternatives during off-peak times. The system also ensures that tolls are adjusted according to demand, balancing traffic flow across different routes.</p>

            <h2>Vehicle Registration and License Plate Recognition System</h2>
            <p>The Vehicle Registration and License Plate Recognition (LPR) system leverages advanced computer vision technology to automatically capture and recognize vehicle license plates in real time. This system is widely used in toll collection, law enforcement, and urban parking management to improve efficiency and reduce human error.</p>
            <p>By integrating LPR technology with vehicle databases, the system can accurately identify vehicles and match them with registration records. This allows for seamless tolling, efficient parking management, and enhanced security through automated vehicle identification.</p>
